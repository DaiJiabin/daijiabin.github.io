What is interface? An interface is one of the more overloaded and confusing terms in development. It is actually a concept of abstraction and encapsulation. For a given “box”, it declares the “inputs” and “outputs” of that box. In the world of software, that usually means the operations that can be invoked on the box (along with arguments) and in some cases the return types of these operations. What it does not do is define what the semantics of these operations are, although it is commonplace (and very good practice) to document them in proximity to the declaration (e.g., via comments), or to pick good naming conventions. Nevertheless, there are no guarantees that these intentions would be followed. Here is an analogy: Take a look at your television when it is off. Its interface are the buttons it has, the various plugs, and the screen. Its semantics and behavior are that it takes inputs (e.g., cable programming) and has outputs (display on the screen, sound, etc.). However, when you look at a TV that is not plugged in, you are projecting your expected semantics into an interface. For all you know, the TV could just explode when you plug it in. However, based on its “interface” you can assume that it won’t make any coffee since it doesn’t have a water intake. In object oriented programming, an interface generally defines the set of methods (or messages) that an instance of a class that has that interface could respond to. What adds to the confusion is that in some languages, like Java, there is an actual interface with its language specific semantics. In Java, for example, it is a set of method declarations, with no implementation, but an interface also corresponds to a type and obeys various typing rules. In other languages, like C++, you do not have interfaces. A class itself defines methods, but you could think of the interface of the class as the declarations of the non-private methods. Because of how C++ compiles, you get header files where you could have the “interface” of the class without actual implementation. You could also mimic Java interfaces with abstract classes with pure virtual functions, etc. An interface is most certainly not a blueprint for a class. A blueprint, by one definition is a “detailed plan of action”. An interface promises nothing about an action! The source of the confusion is that in most languages, if you have an interface type that defines a set of methods, the class that implements it “repeats” the same methods (but provides definition), so the interface looks like a skeleton or an outline of the class.

This is totally different to the thesis talk at the end of the seminar, which will require you to give a high level overview of your topic In your kick-off presentation you managed to present the contents of the paper, but I was somewhat confused that you stuck so closely to how the paper was laid out - it’s almost like you summarized every 4 paragraphs of the paper into one sentence of your own, then presented that Of course, that’s enough to pass the first stage of the seminar, but it’s very far removed from what you are supposed to do in the final presentation. In the seminar talk (or the seminar thesis), if you find yourself explaining parts of a single paper, you probably went into too much detail. What is required of you in the seminar talk/thesis is to discuss commonalities of multiple papers (or differences of these papers) With this out of the way, let me briefly move on the the talk itself: Your presentation was eloquent and easy to follow, the slide design was simple, but very efficient You could easily make your (virtual) presentation more engaging if you could look at the audience (i.e., your lens) more often Lastly, I was missing a footer on your slides - a common line on every slide (that shows 1) who’s talking, 2) what they are talking about, and 3) which slide number is currently presented) helps follow your presentation and (most importantly) makes it easier to ask questions that is, the audience can raise a question like “could you please explain the picture on slide 5” as opposed to “can you please go back a slide; no, forward; one more; one more; okay, maybe it was the other way”… which wastes a lot of time during Q\u0026A I can also recommend asking Dr. Hensel for feedback - he took very good notes as well 13.05.2021 I am happy to see that you’ve made a very important observation: different papers define the same term differently. This is why it is so important to introduce terms in your thesis before using them (“Foobar Computing, which is commonly used to mean XYZ, has gained …\") Browsing through your screenshots it is clear that there are a lot of common distinctions that papers draw between, e.g., fog and edge computing. It is your personal contribution (and also your duty) to arrive at a distinction in your thesis that makes sense (based on the literature you read) and to clearly communicate it to your readers. For example, only one paper treats the two terms as interchangeable, so I would argue that it would not be following the consensus of the literature to treat the two terms as interchangeable in your seminar thesis. Ok😄 I’ll try to make clear distinctions in thesis.🙌And one more question, since Cisco is the “creator” of fog computing, and now on its website Cisco regard FC as a subset of EC(the last picture), does that mean that the second figure is better compared to the first figure? I can only answer this question in a very generic fashion: by default, I would treat exactly those authors as the “creators” of a concept/methodology that first described it in a scientific (peer reviewed) paper. Very often (but not always), this is also the paper that is cited most often for further information on a concept (e.g., “fog computing [1] is being used to XYZ”). On a related note, it is also (unfortunately) very common to simply use the exact same method X that somebody else invented, but to give it a new term Y - just to be able to claim that “I invented Y”; this is particularly common if Y is claimed as an invention by somebody who is in the market of selling Y. Roger that🙌 I’ll try to figure this out.

Auch beim Nebenjob sollen sie ständig daran denken, wie sie das Gelernte in der Praxis umsetzen sollen. Und dies erfolgt nur bei einem fachbezogenen Job. 专业相关的工作也是学业与实习的连接。许多在学习过程中获得的知识，将会在专业相关的工作中得以应用。而且专业知识也将会通过在这类工作中所积累的经验而得以补充(ergänzen)。 Ein fachbezogner Job ist auch eine Verbindung zwischen der Praxis und dem Studium. Vieles, was man sich während des Studiums erworben hat, wird in einem fachbezogenen Job angewandt. Und die Fachkenntnisse werden durch gesammelte Erfahrungen bei solchen Jobs ergänzt. Übergang: 做兼职工作的意图或多或少都折射(widerspiegeln)了资产独立的意愿。但此外(hinaus)他们应该思考全局(Tellerrand)。 Die Absicht, einen Ferienjob zu machen, spiegelt mehr oder weniger den Wunsch nach finanzieller Unabhängigkeit wider.

Wenn man an einem fremden Ort bestimmite Adresse sucht, benötigt man eine ausführliche Wegbeschreibung. Aber unterwegs kann man nichts aufschreiben. Mit Hilfe von SMS wird alles auf dem Display dargestellt, so dass man sich leicht orientieren kann. SMS也有聊天的作用。伴着重要的信息人们也会发送一些笑话或简短的历史。当一个人孤身一人感到无聊的时候，他就可以阅读之前存储的有趣的SMS并转发(weiterleiten)。以此越来越多的人在日常生活中感受欢乐。正是这些社会性的功能对SMS的使用及扩散尤为重要。 SMS hat eine Unterhaltungsfunktion.

Wenn man allein ist und sich langweilig fühlt, kann man die vorher gespeicherten interessanten SMS lesen und weiterleiten. Dabei erleben immer mehr Menschen Freude im Alltag. Genau diese soziale Funktion ist besonders wichtig für die Nutzung und Verbreitung von SMS. 这种新的交流对绩效的提高有所贡献。在SMS中句子将写(verfassen)为更为短小的形式。这有一个优点，人可以快速地获得(vermitteln)观点或从他人得到观点。阅读时间将会显著缩短。在如今快速的(schnellebig)时代人有许多需要阅读的东西，并因此没有内在损失(Verlust)的短句十分的重要。 Die neue Kommunikation trägt zur Leistungserhöhung bei. In SMS werden die Sätze in kurzer Form verfasst. Dies hat einen Vorteil, dass man ganz schnell die Meinungen vermittelt oder die Meinungen von anderen bekommt. Die Lesezeit wird wesentlich verkürzt. In dem heutigen schnellebigen Zeitalter hat man viel zu lesen und deshalb sind kurze Sätze ohne inhaltlichen Verlust ganz wichtig.

Sie können richtige Orientierung bekommen. Ihre Hauptaufgabe besteht darin, dass sie sich durchs Lernen immer weiter qualifizieren und sich auf blendende Zukunft vorbereiten. Ohne Kontrolle werden viele junge Menschen in Sucht und Abhängigkeit verfallen. 管控使儿童和青少年地良好习惯成为可能。他们应该在日常生活中设计一个正确的计划，以充实生活。他们应该明白，他们的生活不仅仅只由电脑和互联网组成。 Die Kontrolle kann den Kindern und Jugendlichen gute Gewohnheit ermöglichen. Sie sollen im Alltag einen richtigen Plan schmieden, um das Leben zu bereichern. Sie sollten wissen, dass ihr Leben nicht nur aus Computer und Internet besteht. 这与健康有关。一方面管控对青少年的物理健康的改良有所贡献。当人在电脑面前坐太久，不仅仅是眼睛，脊椎也会被损伤。年轻人应该按时睡觉，而不是忙于电脑游戏或聊天直到深夜。另一方面管控也关照青年人的心理健康。因为儿童和青少年可以在有害信息前被保护。许多关于暴力、犯罪、诈骗和性将会损伤年轻人的心理健康。 Es geht um Gesundheit. Zum einen trägt die Kontrolle zur Verbesserung physiologischer Gesundheit der Jugendlichen bei. Wenn man zu lange vor dem Computer sitzt, werden nicht nur Augen, sondern auch Wirbelsäulen geschädigt. Die jungen Leute sollen pünktlich ins Bett gehen, statt Computerspiele oder Chat bis in die Nacht zu treiben. Zum anderen sorgt die Kontrolle auch die psychische Gesundheit der Jugendlichen. Denn die Kinder und Jugendlichen können vor schädlichen Informationen geschützt werden. Viele Informationen über Gewalt, Kriminalität, Betrüge und Sex werden die psychische Gesundheit der jungen Leute beeinträchtigen. Kontra: 短时期内青少年得到多面且丰富的信息会被阻碍。 Kurzfristig können die Jugendlichen verhindert werden, an vielfältige und reichliche Informationen zu kommen. 儿童和青少年失去了自我控制的机会。独自一人的时候自律不会自己出现。当学校和父母给学生和儿童展示互联网上的何种内容是对儿童、青少年合适的以及如何计划他们的时间，这再好不过了。 Kinder und Jugendlichen verlieren die Chance, sich selbst zu kontrollieren. Die Selbstdisziplin kommt nicht automatisch von allein. Es wäre besser, wenn Schulen und Eltern den Schülern und den Kindern zeigen, welche Inhalte im Internet für Kinder und Jugendliche geeignet sind und wie sie ihre Zeit planen können. 当儿童们仅仅使用传统的媒体学习是很无聊的。因为知识在互联网上会连续的更新。除此之外互联网上的知识比在书上更加直观。许多电脑游戏也须要战略以及对游戏的思考。由此年轻人将自己明白，有意义地使用电脑和互联网。 Es ist langweilig für Kinder, wenn sie nur mit traditionallen Medien lernen.

Die Zeit, die der Stau kostet, ist mindestens dreifach wie die Zeit, die man für ein unerwünschtes Telefonat zu Hause braucht. Ganz zu schweigen davon ist, dass die Fahrt zur Arbeit sehr viel Benzin verbraucht und damit auch die Luft verschmutzt. 现代交通技术使得许多办公室的工作在家里完成成为可能。在这个意义上办公室和家没有太大的区别。 Mit der modernen Kommunikationstechnik ist es jetzt möglich, viele Büroarbeiten zu Hause zu erledigen. In diesem Sinne gibt es keinen großen Unterschied zwischen Büro und zu Hause. 公司以及职员都可以从居家办公中获益。因为更长的工作时间企业必须为他们的职员支付附加费，这对企业来讲无疑是一份附加的负担。 Sowohl die Unternehmen als auch die Angestellten können von der Heimarbeit profitieren. Wegen der längeren Arbeitszeit müssen die Unternehmen einen Zuschlag für ihre Mitarbeiter zahlen, der sicherlich eine zusätzliche finanzielle Belastung für die Unternehmen ist. 当人在家里工作时拥有灵活的工作时间。因为人可以根据自己的意愿组织他工作的时间。优点是，人可以做一些日常活动并更多地关照他的家庭。 Man hat flexible Arbeitszeit, wenn man zu Hause arbeitet. Denn man kann die Zeit für seine Arbeit nach eigenem Wunsch organisieren. Der Vorteil ist, dass man seine eigenen Tätigkeiten machen und sich mehr um seine Familie kümmern kann. 人在家里可以高效地工作。人可以在早上稍微赖床一会，之后在写字桌前注意力完全集中地工作。 Man kann zu Hause effizient arbeiten. Man kann morgens ein bisschen länger schlafen und dann ganz konzentriert am Schreibtisch arbeiten. 当人在家里工作时人可以拥有更多自由的时间。人不需要每早早早起床并匆忙地驾驶汽车或搭乘公交去办公室工作。 Man kann mehr Freizeit haben, wenn man zu Hause arbeitet. Man braucht nicht jeden Morgen früh aufzustehen und ganz eilig mit Pkw oder Bus ins Büro zu fahren. Kontra: 家中有许多消遣，因此人经常不能集中精力工作并因此浪费许多时间。 Es gibt viele Ablenkungen zu Hause, so dass man sich oft nicht auf die Arbeit konzentrieren kann und damit viel Zeit verloren geht. 当许多工作者在家中工作时，效率会降低。如今在许多领域团队合作是必要的。在做许多重要的决定之前建议或者草稿必须被彻底讨论。这仅在办公室里奏效。当人不在办公室里他的职位上时，那么这将十分重要，呼叫所有的员工来一起研讨。人必须长时间的等待，直到某些人从家里来到办公室。 Wenn viele Erwerbstätige zu Hause arbeiten, sinken die Effizienzen. Heutzutage ist die Teamarbeit in vielen Bereichen notwendig. Vor vielen wichtigen Entscheidungen müssen Vorschläge oder Entwürfe ausdiskutiert werden. Das erfolgt nur im Büro. Wenn man nicht im Büro an seinem Arbeitsplatz ist, dann ist es sehr wichtig, alle Mitarbeiter zur Besprechung zusammenzurufen. Man muss lange warten, bis jemand von zu Hause ins Büro kommt. 当人在家里工作时，不可能每时每刻与同时交流。企业将由此受影响。因为合作以及团队精神对企业的成功来讲是第一线。当人已经习惯居家工作时，人不会喜欢同其他人一起工作。更糟糕的是，人会慢慢的从外部世界独立并可能因此罹患抑郁。 Es ist nicht mehr möglich, jederzeit mit Kollegen zu kommunizieren, wenn man zu Hause arbeitet. Davon wird vor allem das Unternehmen betroffen. Denn für Erfolg eines Unternehmens zählen in erster Linie die Zusammenarbeit und der Teamgeist. Wenn man schon an die Heimarbeit gewöhnt ist, arbeitet man nicht mehr gerne mit anderen Menschen zusammen. Noch schlimmer ist, dass man langsam von der Außenwelt isoliert ist und damit sehr wahrscheinlich an Depression leiden kann. 当更多公共服务的职员在家工作时，人会有更多的问题和困难。让人生气的是，当一些公共职位一直处于未被占据的状态。因此许多人的时间将被挥霍，因为公共服务技术人员的缺失而必须经常等待一整个上午。 Man hat mehr Probleme und Schwierigkeiten, wenn mehr Angestellte im öffentlichen Dienst zu Hause arbeiten.

Anhand des Hybrid-TV-Gerätes können die Jugendlichen politische Ereignisse im Fernsehen verfolgen und dabei ihre Meinungen äußern und an einigen Umfragen im Fernsehen aktiv teilnehmen. Kontra: 对青少年来讲告别这类设备间或会越来越困难。 Es manchmal wird für Jugendliche immer schwieriger, sich von den Hybrid-TV-Geräten zu verabschieden. 尽管这类电视设备或多或少使得聊天变得轻松，但这并不意味着，没有互联网人便不能同他人交流。由此看来(Von daher)这项技术并不是不可或缺的。 Obwohl diese TV-Gerät mehr oder weniger das Chatten erleichert, aber das bedeutet nicht, dass man sich mit anderen ohne Internet nicht unterhalten kann. Von daher ist diese Technik nicht unentbehrlich. 这类设备会损伤青少年的健康。过度使用电视和互联网会损伤眼睛。 Solches Gerät schädet der Gesundheit der Jugendlichen.

Da die schöne Verpackung ihrer Meinung nach allein den Umsatz erhöhen kann, verringert der Hersteller viele Erzeugungskosten. 人必须明白（einsehen），多面的包装影响顾客的购买决定。消费者（Verbraucher）可能因为华丽的（prächtig）包装而购买一个质量低下的产品。 Man muss doch einsehen, dass die vielfältige Verpackung die Kaufentscheindung der Konsumenten beeinflusst. Die Verbraucher können wegen der prächtigen Verpackung ein Produkt mit niedriger Qualität kaufen. 一些包装难以被循环利用（recycle），当他们由塑料生产比如塑料薄膜（Plastikfolie）和塑料袋（Plastiktüte）。当人随意丢弃（herumwerfen）它们时，他们漂浮（schweben）在空中或者躺在地上。这样环境将被污染。一个塑料袋经常被短时间的使用，它们降解（Zum Verrotten）却需要至多500年。人类的健康也会被危及生命的细菌威胁，当生活用品的包装不整洁地（ungereinigt）乱放（herumliegen） Manche Verpackung sind schwer zu recyceln, wenn sie aus Plastik bestehen wie Plastikfolie und Plastiktüte.

Zwar haben fast alle Abiturienten ein Ziel, dass sie mit ihrem Studienabschluss eine gut bezahlte Arbeit finden, wodurch sie Karriere und materiellen Wohlstand verwirklichen können. Dabei versuchen sie, ein glückliches Leben zu führen. Aber man muss damit rechnen, dass das Geld nicht immer die einzige entscheidende Voraussetzung für das Glück und die Freude des Lebens schafft. Noch wichtiger sind die geistige Bereicherung und Selbstverwirklichung. Wenn die Arbiturienten überhaupt kein Interesse für ein Studiunfach wie Maschinenbau oder Informatik haben, finden sie auch keinen Spaß während ihres Studiums. Im Vergleich dazu sind die jungen Menschen ständig motiviert, wenn das Studienfach ihnen gefällt. Selbst wenn sie während des Studiums große Schwierigkeiten haben, können sie es aushalten und ihr Studium mit guten Leistungen absolvieren. 广为人知的意见是，如学习如哲学或教育学的人文科学家，很难找到一个工作岗位，是彻底（durchaus）不正确的。所有人都知道，哲学视作许多学业的基础（Grundlage）。在我们现代社会中没有哲学知识的工程师几乎不能想象。教育学也是科技发展的根基（Fundament）并培养了（für A. sorgen）有资质的工作人员。因此长远来看人文科学家也有欣欣向荣的（blühend）未来。 Die weit verbereitete Auffassung ist, dass die Geistenswissenschaftler, die z.B.

Ingenieure ohne philosophische Kenntnisse sind in unserer modernen Gesellschaft kaum zu denken.

Ältere Lehrer sind körperlich nicht mehr so fit. Da die Arbeit in der Schule oft anstrengend ist, werden ältere Lehrer leicht krank.

Was sie verdienen, hilft aber nur wenig, die Familie finanziell zu entlasten. 儿童在危险且剥削性质（ausbeuterisch）的条件下为微薄的（kümmerlich）收入辛苦工作（schupfen），并为此牺牲（opfern）了自己的健康。长远来看缺乏的教育是一个后果，但其中之一的原因就是儿童工作。因为家长无法承担（sich leisten）儿童上学或忽视了教育的意义。这些儿童得不到一份高薪工作所必要知识的机会。他们必须一生（das Leben lang）做简单的、廉价的工作。当这些儿童长大后，拥有了自己的家庭，也就是说拥有了自己的孩子，所有的一切都将如同他们的父母运行。以此产生了恶性循环（Teufelkreis）。为了打断（durchbrechen）这个恶性循环，父母必须如此想（auf A. kommen）：知识是对他们以及他们的孩子唯一的救赎（Rettung） Die Kinder schuften unter gefährlichen und ausbeuterischen Bedingungen für kümmerliches Einkommen und opfern dabei ihre Gesundheit. Ferne ist mangelnde Bildung eine Folge, aber auch eine der Ursachen von Kinderarbeit. Weil die Eltern sich einen Schulbesuch der Kinder nicht leisten können oder die Bedeutung der Bildung ignorieren, bekommen diese Kinder keine Gelegenheit, notwendige Kenntnisse für eine gut bezahlte Arbeit zu bekommen. Sie müssen das Leben lang eine einfache und schlecht bezahlte Arbeit machen. Wenn diese Kinder groß werden, eigene Familie bzw. eigene Kinder haben, läuft alles genauso wie bei ihren Eltern. So entsteht der Teufelskreis. Um diesen Teufelskreis zu durchbrechen, müssen die Eltern darauf kommen, dass das Wissen die einzige Rettung für sich und vor allem für ihre Kinder ist.

Da ausländische Studierende aus verschiedenen Kultur kommen, haben Studierende an deutschen Hochschulen die Möglichkeit, während der Studienzeit verschiedene Kurturen und Mentalitäten kennenzulernen. Dies trägt dazu bei, dass die Absolventen ohne große Schwierigkeiten international eingesetzt werden. In einer globalisierten Welt ist diese Qualifikation bei Unternehmen besonders gefragt. Durch den Erfolg der Absolventen verbessern deutsche Hochschulen natürlich auch ihr Ansehen in der Fachwelt. 此措施旨在于（sorgen dafür, dass…），德国高校可以同外国高校建立联系。因为许多外国学业申请者早已在他们的祖国结结束了学业。如果他们在德国高校学习的话，他们将会促进他们祖国的高校与德国高校之间的联系。通过国际合作德国高校必然打造他们的名声（Ruf schaffen）。 Diese Maßnahme sorgt dafür, dass die deutschen Hochschulen Kontakt mit ausländischen Hochschulen verknüpfen können. Denn viele ausländische Studienbewerber haben schon ein abgeschlossenes Studium in ihrem Heimat. Wenn sie an deutschen Hochschulen studieren, werden sie Kontakt zwischen Hochschule in ihrem Heimatland und deutscher Hochschule vermitteln. Durch internationale Zusammenarbeit werden deutsche Hochschulen sicherlich ihren Ruf schaffen. 外国学生带来了多样的文化。这将有助于德国高校和德国学生体验其他文化。通过与外国学生的交流德国学生不仅完善了他们的外语知识，也完善了他们的交流能力。在全球化的框架下越来越多的德国人为外国企业工作。因此这些德国学生在在校期间获得的文化经验可以对他们的职业生活十分重要。毕业生越成功，德国高校的形象（Image）也就越好。 Die ausländischen Studenten bringen vielfältige Kulturen mit sich. Dies trägt dazu bei, dass deutsche Hochschulen und Studierende andere Kulturen erfahren können. Durch die Kommunikation mit ausländischen Studierenden verbessern die deutschen Studenten nicht nur ihre Fremdsprachenkenntnisse, sondern auch ihre Kommunikationsfähigkeit. Im Rahmen der Globalisierung arbeiten immer mehr Deutsche für ausländische Firmen. Deshalb können die kulturellen Erfahrungen, die die deutschen Studenten an der Universität erworben haben, sehr wichtig für ihr Berufsleben sein. Je erfolgreicher die Absolventen sind, desto besser wird das Image deutscher Hochschulen. Kontra: 通过限制外国学生教授可以在学期、Vorlesung上传授更多的知识，当大多数参与者是德国学生的时候。 Durch die Begrenzung der ausländischen Studierenden können die Professoren in Seminar und Vorlesung mehr Kenntnisse vermitteln, wenn die meisten Teilnehmer deutsche Studierende sind. 随着外国学生数目的增长高校资源会紧缺。学生可能必须为学生公寓的一间房间或辅导时间的一个Termin等待稍长一些。但这些困难恰好对学生来讲是一个有意义的前提。此间他们应该尝试，用自己的力量解决问题、克服困难（Schwierigkeiten bewältigen）。这种自立能力对他们的职业生活尤为重要。因为在他们的职业中高校毕业生所有可能的任务和问题。在此他们的处理能力是一项决定性的资质，这也是德国高校应该重视(auf… großen Wert legen)的 (优点+缺点)Mit der zunehmenden Zahl ausländischer Studierenden werden die Ressourcen von Hochschulen knapp. Die Studierenden, müssen vielleicht ein bisschen länger auf ein Zimmer im Studentenwohnheim oder einen Termin für Sprechstunden warten. Aber solche Schwierigkeiten sind gerade eine sinnvolle Herausforderung für Studierende. Dabei sollen sie versuchen, mit eigener Kraft Probleme zu lösen und Schwierigkeiten selbst zu bewältigen. Diese Selbstständigkeit ist besonders wichtig für ihr Berufsleben. Denn in ihrem Beruf haben die Hochschulabsolventen alle möglichen Aufgaben und Probleme. Dabei ist ihre Handlungsfähigkeit eine entscheidene Qualifikation, worauf deutsche Hochschulen großen Wert legen sollen.

Dadurch sind die in der Lage, Theorie, die an der Uni vermittelt ist, mit Praxis in Verbindung zu setzen.

Viele Fachleute haben langjährige praktische Erfahrungen. Diese Erfahrungen sind für die Einarbeitung der Hochschulabsolventen wertvoll und stehen eben nicht in irgendwelchen Lehrbüchern. Während des Praktikums haben sie auch die Möglichkeit, sich dem Arbeitgeber persönlich vorzustellen und dabei einen positiven Eindruck zu machen. Dies sorgt für eine relativ reibungslose Einstellung. 人可以找到很多使用他的知识的机会。当一位医学生面前有一位患者时，他便有可能实际使用他在教科书上读到过的治疗法。 Man kann mehr Chancen haben, Anwendung für sein Wissen finden. Wenn ein Mediziner einen Patienten vor sich hat, hat er die Möglichkeit, Therapie, die er in den Lehrbüchern gelesen hat, praktisch verwenden. 学生可以同企业建立(verknüpfen)紧密的联系(Kontakt zu)并认识许多专业人士。这可以变得很有帮助：当他们之后寻找一份工作的时候。一名想要在办公厅(Kanzlei)工作的法律学者可以通过实习打听判决(Gerichts)前的流程。这是赢得一场官司处理的第一步也是重要的一步(Schritt zu) Studierende können engen Kontakt zu Unternehmen verknüpfen und viele Fachleute kennen lernen. Das kann hilfreich sein, wenn sie später einen Job suchen. Durch Praktikum kann ein Rechtswissenschaftler, der in einer Kanzlei arbeiten möchte, sich über den Prozess vor Gericht informieren. Das wäre ein erster und wichtiger Schritt zum Gewinn einer Gerichtsverhandlung. Kontra: 有一些将实习生作为廉价劳动动力使用的企业。实习对高校毕业生来讲也是一个附加的时间浪费。 Es gibt einige Unternehmen, welche die Praktikanten als günstige Arbeitskräfte ausnutzen. Auch für Hochshculabsolventen ist ein Praktikum ein zusätzlicher Zeitaufwand. 一些实习生可以在学业结束后在企业花费一些更多的时间。除此之外一些实习生不可以凭他们的工作得到薪水。 Einige Praktikanten können nach ihrem Studium bei Unternehmen ein bisschen mehr Zeit aufwenden.
